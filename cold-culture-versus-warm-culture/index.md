# Cold culture versus warm culture

[Source](https://aella.substack.com/p/cold-and-warm-cultures)

Maybe a term for this dichotamy already exists elsewhere, but I haven’t heard it yet and have found my own term for it super useful, so here we go:

**Cold Culture examples**

* Highly efficient in small things

* Knows how much time is worth, e.g. might consciously spend no more than 1 minute selecting a grocery product with a price difference lower than a dollar

* Libertarian-esque; pays attention to system efficiency, not what ‘feels good’

* Willing to use money to incentivize things in their personal life, e.g. “if you figure out my emotional issue I’ll pay you 1k” or “paying a roommate to do chores for you”

* More risk-tolerant; likely to view downsides or problems as sometimes being worthwhile tradeoffs

* More likely to place responsibility inside the self; views others as ultimately not responsible for your well being

* Less likely to parse things as exploitation or manipulation; views additional choices as non-coercive (e.g., a new employer offering well below minimum wage is not viewed as exploitative)

* Donates to efficient charities; utilitarian

* Ask culture: a frame where people should ask directly for what they want with the expectation that the askee will say no if they don’t want to

* High decoupling

* Destination over the journey

**Warm Culture examples**

* More attention to the subjective, emotive, connective world

* More disgust sensitive (more likely to resist things that trigger moral disgust, such as homosexuality or sex work. this is highly relative to culture)

* Persuaded by sense of fairness

* Distrusts conscious signaling as manipulative; e.g., really hates pickup artistry because it’s making deliberate something that is otherwise organic and intuitive

* Wary of manipulation in general; more likely to perceive manipulation as genuinely subverting individual agency

* Perceives responsibility as resting more outside the self or diversified; others can be responsible for your well being

* Views some voluntary options as coercive or exploitative; e.g. less likely to allow a rich private individual to pay voluntary minority groups to get sterilized

* Naturalistic and community oriented

* Dislikes advertising and capitalism

* Guess culture: a frame where there can be harm in asking for things because of implicit pressure for the askee to agree even if they don’t want to

* Low decoupling

* Journey over the destination
